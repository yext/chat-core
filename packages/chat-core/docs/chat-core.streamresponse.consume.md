## StreamResponse.consume() method

Reads data from a stream response and invokes callbacks from event listeners for each chunk of data that is read.

**Signature:**

```typescript
consume(): Promise<void>;
```
**Returns:**

Promise&lt;void&gt;

## Remarks

Once the data has been consumed from the stream, this method will simply return immediately on subsequent calls.
