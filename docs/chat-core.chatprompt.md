## ChatPrompt type

The type of prompts to be used by the Chat bot. Experimental changes to prompts will be applied to the "nightly" package and subsequently moved into "stable" after performance and reliability are verified. It is STRONGLY recommended not to use "nightly" in production Chat bots.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type ChatPrompt = "stable" | "nightly";
```
